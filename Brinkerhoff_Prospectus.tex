\section{Proposal} \label{sec:Introduction}
%------------------------------------

My dissertation addresses how phonology and phonetics account for differences in voice quality. 
Voice quality describes how the larynx can be manipulated during speech to affect how the sounds are produced. Most commonly, in speech, these manipulations have a breathy or creaky voice quality \citep{eslingVoiceQualityLaryngeal2019}. 
In some languages, like English, the amount of breathiness or creakiness produced when we speak does not significantly affect what we say. 
However, this is different in other languages across the world. For example, in many Mesoamerica and Southeast Asian indigenous languages, voice quality differences can drastically change a word's meaning \citep{espositoCrossLinguisticPatterns2020}.
In the endangered Zapotec language Santiago Laxopa Zapotec (SLZ) spoken by approximately 1000 speakers in the municipality of Santiago Laxopa, Ixtlán, Oaxaca, Mexico \citep{adlerAcousticsPhonationTypes2016, adlerDerivationVerbInitiality2018, brinkerhoffDownstepSantiagoLaxopaMFM, foleyForbiddenCliticClusters2018, SantiagoLaxopaEconomy, sichelFeaturalLifeNominals2020, silva-roblesElicitingAssociatedMotion2022} there are four unique voice qualities breathy, checked, rearticulated, and modal. 
Breathy vowels are realized with a breathy voice during any point of the vowel. 
Checked and rearticulated vowels are realized with creaky voice but in different locations within the vowel (i.e., checked vowels have creakiness at the end while rearticulated vowels have creakiness at the middle).
Modal vowels, or the default vowel, do not have any laryngeal modification. 

My dissertation will address several questions about how these voice quality distinctions are produced and what they can tell us about how these sounds are organized in the sound system of SLZ. The first concerns the phonetic realization or how SLZ makes these sounds. Initial investigations into these voice qualities by \citet{adlerAcousticsPhonationTypes2016} and \citet{brinkerhoffResidualH1MeasureInPreparation} have revealed some information about this question, mainly what acoustic measures best capture the contrasts between these qualities. \citet{adlerAcousticsPhonationTypes2016} showed that spectral tilt can account for the four voice quality distinctions in SLZ. This acoustic measure looks at the speech signal's relative amplitude of sound waves \citep{fischer-jorgensenPhoneticAnalysisBreathy1968}. \citeauthor{adlerAcousticsPhonationTypes2016} found that two different spectral tilt measures can capture the distinctions. However, recent work in \citet{brinkerhoffResidualH1MeasureInPreparation} on ten SLZ speakers shows that most spectral tilt measures are not good at capturing the voice quality distinctions. Instead, we found that most spectral tilt measures could only catch some differences. Instead, the acoustic measure called Strength of Excitation, which measures how strongly the vocal folds are vibrating \citep{murtyEpochExtractionSpeech2008, mittalStudyEffectsVocal2014}, and a new acoustic measure proposed by \citet{chaiH1H2Acoustic2022}, Residual H1, better capture the voice quality contrasts in SLZ. This aligns with more recent work by \citet{chaiH1H2Acoustic2022} and \citet{zhangCauseeffectRelationshipVocal2016, zhangMechanicsHumanVoice2016}, where they show and discuss how spectral tilt measures are not as robust as previously thought. My dissertation expands on this discussion about why spectral tilt measures fail to capture the contrasts in SLZ and the role that Strength of Excitation, residual H1, and other acoustic measures play in establishing and describing these voice quality distinctions. This phonetic knowledge is critical in explaining how these voice qualities are produced.

It is commonly accepted that the sounds used by language are organized and stored in an abstract language system we call the phonological component of mental grammar. Different linguistic theories argue that there is little to no phonetic input \citep{reissSubstanceFreePhonology2017}, whereas others say that phonetics and phonology are entirely unified with total overlap \citep{flemmingScalarCategoricalPhenomena2001}. One of the questions that my dissertation will address is to what extent the data from SLZ voice quality can shed light on this interaction, particularly how it relates to the representation of these sounds in the phonological component of mental grammar. These phonological representations form the building blocks from which our understanding of how sounds pattern and are organized into cohesive systems. There is debate about how information is stored in these phonological representations. Some linguists argue that only a single form is stored (e.g., \cite{albrightIdentificationBasesMorphological2002}). Others argue that instead, we have a set of multiple forms stored (e.g., \cite{mascaroExternalAllomorphyLexical2007}) or all the actual forms spoken or heard (e.g., exemplar theory, \cite{ernestusIntraparadigmaticEffectsPerception2007}). Essentially, these views ask how abstract these phonological representations could be for the grammar to operate. My dissertation will contribute to the ongoing debate about the nature of these phonological representations.

% \section{Previous and current work} \label{sec:Work}
% %------------------------------------

% The dissertation grew from work I conducted for my second qualifying paper, a preliminary description and analysis of voice quality based on consultant data collected during the COVID-19 lockdowns. This was based on two speakers that live in the Monterey Bay area. This preliminary data showed that what was reported in \citep{adlerAcousticsPhonationTypes2016} might be more complicated than previously assumed. In the summer of 2022, I traveled to Oaxaca. With the help of a colleague, I collected fresh data from 15 individuals doing word list elicitations with lexical items that had each of the four different voice qualities present, as well as new vocabulary items, stories, and recipes. Over the past two years, I have been annotating the data and running small-scale acoustic analyses on a portion of the data. The result of this was my qualifying exam. During the summer of 2024, the annotation was completed on the word lists, and a new analysis was conducted, which showed, as mentioned above, that traditional spectral tilt measures were not as robust on this large-scale analysis. This research was submitted to a conference and is being prepared for publication \citep{brinkerhoffResidualH1MeasureInPreparation}. Data collection is completed; however, this does not rule out the possibility that I might need to return to Laxopa to collect additional data. I am researching the theoretical implications of the results, as discussed above. I am currently reading and evaluating the literature on phonological representations. A timeline for the remaining steps is provided below.
